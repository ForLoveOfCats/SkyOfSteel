## Steps to Contribute


### First Submit a Proposal
Before starting work on a new feature or major bugfix make sure to submit a
proposal in the form of a Github bug report. Explain the feature or bugfix you
wish to add or fix and give any information on how you plan on doing so. This
is very important as it makes sure that the scope of work and the implementation
are good before work is started. Otherwise the merge might have to be rejected
which is rather disheartening for all parties involved.


### Then Start Work
Once the proposal has been approved and the approach deemed sound work can
begin. While working make sure to keep a tidy commit history with well sized
commits which have short descriptive names. Of course it goes without saying
that one should work to produce high quality code. If you have any further
questions while working, the proposal bug and the SkyofSteel Discord are both
good placed to ask, depending on the importance and time sensitivity of said
questions.


### Merge Time
When the implementation is finished it is time to submit a PR. Before doing this
make sure that the git log is clean-n-tidy and that only required changes have
been made. In the PR message make sure to link to the original proposal.
